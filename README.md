# Event Buckets with Terraform

## Overview

This project automates the creation and management of S3 buckets on AWS specifically designed for different event themes (e.g., AdventureTech, DataSummit, NatureEscape). It utilizes Terraform to ensure consistency and scalability.

## Current Functionalities

- Dynamically provisions S3 buckets based on event themes.
- Manages bucket lifecycles, including creation, deletion, and modification.
- Integrates with AWS for resource management.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Install Terraform:** Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) to install Terraform.
2. **Configure AWS credentials:** Set up your AWS credentials by following the guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
3. **Initialize Terraform:** Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
4. **Plan infrastructure changes:** Execute `terraform plan` to review planned changes.
5. **Apply changes:** Confirm and apply changes using `terraform apply`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Version control:** Integrate with Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
- **Testing:** Implement Terratest or a similar framework for automated testing.
- **Modularity:** Break down the Terraform code into reusable modules for better organization and maintainability.
- **Error handling:** Enhance error handling and logging for robustness.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices, such as encryption and access controls.
- **Customizability:** Allow users to specify bucket names, regions, and other parameters via variables.
- **Documentation:** Expand the README with detailed usage instructions and examples.
